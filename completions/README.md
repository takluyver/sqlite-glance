## Shell completions for sqlite-glance

The scripts here add completions for table & view names inside a database, as well as command-line options.

### Bash

Copy `sqlite-glance.bash` into `~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions`, and start a new shell.

This requires [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion/),
which is packaged in major Linux distros and often seems to be installed
by default.
